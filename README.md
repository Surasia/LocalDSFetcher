Want to get into API modding/exploration? This tool will download the latest game manifest allowing you to view upcoming maps and gamemodes! 
To parse the JSON, you can use [JSONViewer for Notepad++](https://github.com/kapilratnani/JSON-Viewer) or open it up in Firefox.

For the XBOND file downloaded, you can use [BONDReader](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/bond-reader) to extract info or use [Huragok](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/huragok) to create a projects file to use in custom games. Both are excellent tools made by [Den from OpenSpartan](https://github.com/dend/)

## So- what do I do with the files generated?
